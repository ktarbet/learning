conversation/equation
--------------------
observe behavior -> outcome of behavior -> next step-> ideal outcome

try removing self/you from equation 

yes- Us versus problem
no - you versus team members


a) Must know what is needed to develop?
b) willing to invest time and energy?
c) do they have skills and knowledge required?


Leader should be listening more than talking
assist with new perspecitve with questions rather that suggesting solutions
