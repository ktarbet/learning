Partial Duration - (Peaks over a threshold) 



Parametric modeling : fit model 

Ensure your sample is independent and Identically distributed. (IID)

Multimodal Data - usually caused by a mixed population.   (snow events, rain events)

mixed population analysis - two+ analsis combined.

Interval data - instead of using point data.

Data transformations - Log10, Ln, normal dist, x^2, sqrt, 1/x   

Method of Mements.

Linear Moments - less weight is given to the tails.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation - 

Goodness of Fit tests -  
  K-S = largest diff in CDF
  Chi-Square - sum of (diff between model and data.)
  Anderson-Darling 
  Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
  Akaike information Criterion (AIC)
