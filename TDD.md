Advanced Test Driven Development (TDD) -- Robert Martin

The Tree Laws of Test Driven Development (disipline) 

1) Your are not allowed to write any production code until you have first writtne a unit test that fails due to its absense.
2) You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficent to fail.  Failing to compile is failing.
3) You are not allowed to write more production code than is sufficient to cause the currently failing test to pass.
