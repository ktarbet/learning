M: eyes open helps calm mind more than totally closed

Vipashyana exercise -- where does thought process come from?  where is it's origin? is it volentary(motor muscles,breathing)  or in-volentary (breathing, digestive, circulatory/heart, nervouse system)?  what about thought process is that volentary/in-vol -- homework what is going on in our minds.

shamatha  (shaw-ma-tagh)
focus on specific object.. (when picking object thinkg of senses..  mind,sound,smell,touch, visual(#1), ) senses such as visual are not on 100% of the time. can close eyes, plug ears, not always smelling, and tasting -discontinous

classical choice for attention: breathing.  Tibetians have developed breathing well beyond the scope of this course.

we will try alternative: visual object-- use breathing if that works better . If breathing what do you do with eyes?

use stable (not moving) object : breath or visual object.
the big intrudor is the narrarator, other intrudors sound,
 
do we want object of personal value? can capture attention. Example a picture of a person. pick something that is not too distracting.

homework:
a) practice shamatha . ask question involentary/in-volentary
b) focus on object (or breathing)- beginning examin attributes, shape,size, texture, to stablies mind in present moment (mindfullness).  If breathing focus on the sublities of breathing: strength, depth, blockages, temperature, soft/hard. can count breaths.

[don't over do it-- if distractins increase]
multiple short meditaions may be better than a long one.
different times of day may be better for you.
